Repository (“Repo”) :- a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project. 

1) Branch :- Diversion from main workinfg project (repository)

2) Checkout :- used to switch within the branches
	syntax : git checkout < branch-name>
		 git checkout master
		 git checkout testing 

	NOTE :  Be careful with your staged files and commits 
		when switching between branches.


3)  Clone :- copying a repository
	After cloning a repo into another branch, the newly created becomes
	a remote-tracking branch that can talk upstream to its origin branch
	( via pushes, pulls, and fetches )

4) Fetch :-
	By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying 
	that branch’s files to your workstation. 
	Multiple branches can be fetched at once. 

5) Fork	:- Creates a copy of a repository.
	a project fork is the copying of a project with the purpose
	 of creating a new and separate community around it.

6) HEAD	:- 
	HEAD is a reference variable used to denote the most current commit of
	the repository in which you are working.
 	When you add a new commit, HEAD will then become that new commit.

7) Index :- working or staging area of the git

	changes file <------->  Staging area  <---------------> Commited
	<add,delete etc. >	green files
				{staged and ready to commit}
				
				red files
				{ 
					have not yet been added 
				  	to staged for next commit
				}

8) Master :- The primary branch of all repositories on local system
	
	All committed and accepted changes should be on the master branch.
	You can work directly from the master branch, or create other branches.

9) Pull/Pull Request :- to review the commits made.

	If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project 
	and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, 
	that someone can put in a pull request.

	Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, 
	and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. 

	A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.

10)Push :- Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. 
	   You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.


11) Merge :- Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally master) branch. 
	    These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by a project maintainer.
	
12) Origin : origin is the default alias to the URL of your remote repository.
	     You can see what URL belongs to each remote by using
	     e.g. git remote -v
